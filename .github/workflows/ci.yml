Certainly! Below is an example YAML file for GitHub Actions that builds an application using Next.js 14. This example assumes you want to run the build process on every push to the main branch:

yaml
Copy code
name: Build and Deploy Next.js Application

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

        - name: Lint code
        run: npm run lint

      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build
